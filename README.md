FromSoft Minibosses is a little experiment I built while following a few courses to get up-to-date with modern React. Every aspect of the game is managed using functiona components and hooks: `useState()`, `useRef()`, `useEffct()` and so on, without relying on external state managers or modules. The routing is managed with `react-router-dom`.
